BeatBounce is a Java program that allows songs in a set directory to be switched, or remain playing, according to a pace. The pace, measured in BPM, can be obtained using input from a smartWatch's heart rate monitor or measured step pace. For the purpose of this program, this is simulated by clicks on a mouse or pressing a key at a specific pace. 

Each song in the set directory is set to its BPM. Thus, as the pace changes, the songs will change accordingly. If the pace is constant, the song playing will continue playing.

To use, launch and run main method from "../src/BeatBounceDemo.java". To set a pace, continuously press any key (on the Java Virtual Keyboard) on the keyboard or the 'Step' button with your cursor.
