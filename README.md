BeatBounce is a Java program that plays songs to match your heart rate or step pace. The user's pace, measured in BPM, can be obtained using input from a smartWatch's heart rate monitor or measured step pace. For the purpose of this program, this is instead simulated by clicks on a mouse or pressing a key at a specific rate. 

Each song in the directory is stored with its BPM. Thus, as the user's pace changes, the songs will change accordingly. If the user's pace is constant, the active song will continue playing.

To use, launch and run main method from "../src/BeatBounceDemo.java". To set a pace, continuously press any key (on the Java Virtual Keyboard) on the keyboard or the 'Step' button with your cursor.
